# Threads

A thread is a place to discuss code and code changes. A thread can be about:

- specific lines of code in a repository; or
- all lines that match a search query (with new matches automatically added).

You can use threads to:

- discuss code (so that anyone else viewing the code in the future can see the discussion);
- coordinate large-scale or multi-repository changes; or
- perform other actions in response to code changes.

## Examples

### Ask a question about a line of code

### Monitor all repositories for new npm dependencies

### Watch for new callers of a library you own

### Apply a codemod (programmatic edit) to multiple repositories
